# Vim File Tree

This Vim plug-in provides a simple(!) popup bases file-selector.

To open the file-selector hit `<F2>`. In the file-selector hit `?` to get help.

## Installation

This plugin is based on
[vim-selector-lib](https://github.com/rakus/vim-selector-lib), so this also has

```
call plug#begin()

Plug 'rakus/vim-selector-lib'
Plug 'rakus/vim-file-tree'
